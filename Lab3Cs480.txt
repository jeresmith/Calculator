Shunting yard algorithm for reading math from calculator

Need functions to make sure string is valid

 - all characters are in the hash map CHECK
 - parenthesis make sense CHECK
 - decimals make sense (decimal has number either to left or right). CHECK
 - there's a number in between most functions except trig functions which just needs one after CHECK
 - validate */+- aren't touching one another except CHECK
 - how to check if (1+1)(1+1) if two parenthesis are touching each other to multiply Shuntting yard algorithm might take care of this one also
 - ()-() how to check parenthesis have number in them. Create function making sure there's number in side. ACTUALLY SHUNTING YARD ALGORTHIM WILL CHECK FOR THIS ONE
